# Ninja Game

Welcome to the Ninja Game repository! This is an exciting game where you play as a ninja defending against knights who are coming at you. Your objective is to survive by throwing stars at the knights and using an elixir to jump and avoid their attacks. Be cautious, as the knights can steal your elixir. Collect the necessary score to achieve victory!

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Constructors

This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles, specifically constructors, to create and manage game objects such as the ninja, knights, and elixirs. Constructors are special functions that allow us to create new instances of objects with predefined properties and behaviors. In the context of the Ninja Game:

- The `Ninja` constructor creates the player's character, determining its initial position and movement capabilities.
- The `Knight` constructor defines the properties and behaviors of the enemy knights, such as their appearance and attack patterns.
- The `Elixir` constructor handles the creation and effects of the elixir power-up.
- The `Bottle` constructor create bottle object withc give you more stars
- The `stars` constructor is creating stars witch you can throw when you press space

Using OOP constructors makes the code organized, modular, and easier to manage, as each object type has its own blueprint.
